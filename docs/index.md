* **Until further notice all locations marked with the label "FCTS" will be closed-please let patients know if they are inquiring about an FCTS location**

* **All locations marked with the "Testative" label have both rapid antigen test and PCRS. The rapid takes 10-15 min to get verbal results and 12-24 hours to get documentation, its usually much quicker than that. It just depends on how busy the location is. The PCR takes 3-5 business days.**

* **In the coming weeks we will be adding locations under the label "Testative". Please be aware of the label for each location**

* **Start all calls with, "Hi, this is Free COVID testing. Which state are you calling from?**

* **Before your shift starts you must have Grasshopper, Discord, and this website open**
