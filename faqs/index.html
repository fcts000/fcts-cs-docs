<ul>
<li><strong>Note: If the location is a office or store then the patient will go inside to get tested. If the site is a parking lot then they will park and wait for the technician to come to their car.</strong></li>
<li><strong><font color="red">What is the testing process?</font></strong><ul>
<li><strong>Patient either goes to a parking lot or a store or office location. At the locations they will be required to give their information like first and last name, date of birth, email, phone number,upload a picture of an insurance card if they have one, and upload a picture of a valid government issued ID such as a driver's license. If the patient is a non-citizen their passport will count as valid ID. After filling in all required information the patient will receive the PCR test first and this test is required for all patients to take. The PCR is sent off to the lab and will come back to the patient in the designated time given which is usually around 3 to 4 business days. This time is always subject to change so make sure to always look out for updates. The second test available upon request is the Rapid Antigen Test. This will give results in 10-15 min verbally, but if the patient needs documentation they must request for it and they will receive it in 12-24 hours,it's usually much quicker than that it just depends on how busy the location is. Both Rapid Antigen Test and PCR test are self administered.</strong></li>
